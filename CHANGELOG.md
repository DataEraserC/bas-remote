# Changelog

## 0.7.2

Host-only release: the protocol layer is unchanged and stays at 0.7.1, so
`crates/` is untouched and the Rust half does not need rebuilding.

### Fixed
- **The TUI could not do two things the web panel could.** The web panel and `/bas` had drifted: `POST /bas-remote/landscape` with action `add` and `POST /bas-remote/strict` existed as routes only, so a terminal user had no way to register a landscape without signing in to it in the same breath (only `/bas login <url>` registered one, as a side effect), and no way at all to flip port strictness. `/bas add <landscape>` and `/bas strict [on|off]` close both. A bare `/bas strict` toggles, which is what the panel's button does.

### Changed
- **The slash command is taken from the optional service instead of demanding it.** `@deepseek-ai/dsh-commands` was always an optional `peerDependency`, but `commands` also sat in the plugin's `inject` list — so its absence was a load failure for the whole plugin, taking the tools, the routes and the tunnels with it, not merely the loss of `/bas`. The command is now read with `ctx.reflect.get('commands')` and skipped when the service is missing, which makes the declared optionality true.

## 0.7.1

### Fixed
- **Every dev-channel SSH handshake failed with `SshKey: format encoding error`, so no `bas_connect` got past sign-in.** SAP's dev-tunnel server pads the `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521` signature integers with a zero byte even where RFC 4251 § 5 does not require one, and `ssh-key` rejected the redundancy. `patches/internal-russh-forked-ssh-key` is a vendored copy of the crate that parses those signatures, selected with `[patch.crates-io]`, where a redundant leading zero is stripped instead of rejected. The zero that the sign bit does require is kept, so a well-formed signature decodes to the same value as before.

## 0.7.0

### Changed
- **The project is renamed `bas-remote` and reorganised around the library.** It stopped being a harness plugin with a Rust part and became a Rust library with a harness host, so the npm package, the DSH plugin id, the Nix attribute and the GitHub repository all read `bas-remote` now. The DeepSeek Harness half moved into `hosts/dsh/` — its `package.json`, `lib/`, `test/`, `native/` and `cordis.patch.yml` — so the repository root holds only the Rust workspace, the shared docs and the flake. A second host is a sibling directory under `hosts/`.
- **User-facing paths follow the new name.** The SSH fragment is `~/.ssh/bas-remote.conf`, the SFTP bridge installs into `~/.bas-remote/sftp-bridge/` inside the dev space, and the SSH config markers are `# >>> bas-remote <section>`. Blocks written by 0.6.x under the old markers are still recognised and removed, so an upgraded install does not end up with two blocks for the same `Host`. The plugin state stays at `~/.dsh/bas-remote/state.json`, which already used this name, so stored landscapes and port assignments are read as before.
- The credential id is unchanged: it is derived from the landscape URL alone, so signed-in landscapes stay signed in.

## 0.6.1

### Fixed
- **Browser sign-in was impossible in 0.6.0: the loopback listener did not answer the CORS preflight.** The landscape page posts the token from `https://<landscape>` to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/ext-login`, so the browser sends `OPTIONS` first and drops the `POST` unless the preflight allows the origin. The 0.5.x listener sent `access-control-allow-origin: *`, `allow-headers: content-type` and `allow-methods: POST, OPTIONS` and answered `OPTIONS` with 204; the Rust rewrite kept none of that, and the sign-in failed in the tab with the request never leaving it. The listener now answers the preflight and sends the same headers on every response.
- **The hand-off response carried a hard-coded `content-length: 46` for a 52-byte body** and had switched from `application/json` `{"status":"ok"}` to an HTML page. The body is now the JSON the page expects, with the length taken from the body itself.
- **A request split across TCP segments was parsed from the first read only**, so a body that arrived in two parts was seen as truncated JSON. The listener now reads the whole request — headers, then `content-length` bytes.
- An unusable body is answered with `{"status":"error"}` (the 0.5.x contract) and the listener stays open for a retry, instead of failing the attempt on the first bad request.

## 0.6.0

### Changed
- **The BAS protocol moved out of JavaScript and into a Rust workspace behind a C ABI.** The plugin used to carry ~5 700 lines of Node that spoke to a landscape, opened the dev-channel WebSocket, ran an SSH transport, forwarded ports and installed an SFTP server. All of that is now `bas-core`; the harness half is a thin host that calls one C function. The reason is portability: the protocol no longer depends on a harness platform, a Node version, or `@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh`.
  - `crates/bas-core` — protocol layer: landscape REST, dev-channel SSH-over-WebSocket, `direct-tcpip` forwarding, SFTP bridge, SSH config text. No filesystem, terminal, environment or process access; `crates/bas-core/tests/purity.rs` fails the build if that erodes.
  - `crates/bas-api` — the C ABI (`bas_call` / `bas_free` / `bas_version`, documented in `docs/abi.md`). It owns the two things the protocol layer must not: effects (files, listeners) and live handles (tunnels, sign-ins).
  - `crates/bas-cli` — `bas`, the same operations from a shell, which is also the proof that no harness is required.
- **The dev channel is implemented against the protocol instead of a JavaScript SSH stack.** `russh` + `tokio-tungstenite` speak SSH over the dev-channel WebSocket directly, replacing `@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh`, `@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh-tcp`, `ws` and `ssh2` (all four are gone from `dependencies`). The behaviour is unchanged: `wss://port33765-<host>:443`, the landscape JWT as a bearer token, `none` SSH authentication because the WebSocket already authorised the caller, then `direct-tcpip` to the dev space's `127.0.0.1:2222`.
- **`lib/native.js` replaces four protocol modules.** `lib/landscape.js`, `lib/tunnel.js`, `lib/bridge.js` and `lib/sshconfig.js` are deleted. Every remaining BAS call in `lib/index.js` is one `call(op, args)` from `docs/abi.md`; the tool surface, `/bas` subcommands, `/bas-remote/*` routes, config schema and `state.json` shape are unchanged.
- **The credential id is byte-identical to the 0.5.x implementation**, so landscapes that were already signed in stay signed in after the upgrade. `test/host-native.test.mjs` pins the value.

### Added
- `docs/abi.md` — the complete contract between the halves: the three exported functions, the response envelope, the operation table, and why handles exist.
- `crates/bas-core/tests/devchannel_loopback.rs` — an in-process WebSocket server that speaks SSH (with `none` auth and `direct-tcpip`), so the one path that cannot be mocked is exercised end to end without a BAS landscape.
- `test/native.test.mjs` — the ABI against a real SSH server: exit codes, stderr, background-child commands, `stat`, SSH config round-trip, and a per-call leak check.
- `test/host-native.test.mjs` — the seam: real plugin, real FFI, real Rust. It skips (rather than fails) when the library is absent, so `npm test` still runs without a Rust toolchain.
- `flake.nix` — builds `bas-native` (the library) and the bundle that installs it at `native/libbas_api.so`, which `lib/native.js` finds without any environment variable.

### Fixed
- **A two-call `probe → allocate → call` ABI would have run every operation twice.** The first draft of `docs/abi.md` specified that pattern; it starts two bridge daemons per connect, because "report the size needed" means running the operation to learn the size. `bas_call` now returns an owned string that the caller frees once with `bas_free`.
- **`exec` hung when a remote command left a background process.** A daemon, a `nohup` or the bridge's own start command inherits the channel, so the server sends the exit status but never closes it, and a reader waiting for `close` waits forever. Reading now stops a short grace window after the exit status.
- **`exec` lost the exit status when `eof` arrived first**, which made every failed command look successful (exit code `-1` was reported as if the command ran). The reader now waits for the exit status after `eof`.
- **The SFTP bridge reported `stopped: false` after a successful stop**, because it answered from a pre-kill probe instead of the port's actual state.

## 0.5.0+6

### Changed
- **The four `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges now admit DeepSeek Harness 0.2.1-alpha.1.** They were `^0.1.0 || 0.2.0-rc.2`, which evaluates false for `0.2.1-alpha.1` with or without `includePrerelease`, so the compatibility preflight in the kernel denied the plugin before it loaded. Each range is now `^0.1.0 || ^0.2.0 || 0.2.0-rc.2 || 0.2.1-alpha.1`: `^0.2.0` covers the whole 0.2.x line (the preflight passes `includePrerelease: true`, so `0.2.1-alpha.1` satisfies it) and the two exact alternatives keep `0.2.0-rc.2` and `0.2.1-alpha.1` admitted for any checker that evaluates prereleases strictly.
- The entry affects `dsh-tools`, `dsh-credentials`, `dsh-commands` and `dsh-system-prompt`; `@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `schemastery` and `ws` are untouched because the preflight only evaluates `@deepseek-ai/dsh` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peers.

## 0.5.0+5

### Added
- **Plugins-page configuration row (`plugins.row.config`).** The bundle now registers the 0.2 keyed slot, so its row on the Plugins page gains a configure control: `view: 'summary'` renders the card one-liner (a translated sentence that also serves as the detail page's fallback description) and `view: 'page'` reuses the settings page body — BAS state and actions ride the plugin's own bridge, not the Host's ConfigPageForm, so the `form` prop is deliberately ignored. The registration key is `rowConfigKey('dsh-bas-remote', 'dsh-bas-remote')` (the package name equals the id of the `cordis.patch.yml` insert entry, so one key covers both spellings the Host may derive).
- **Legacy `plugins.item` fallback.** Hosts without the new slot (0.1.7) get the same component as the card body; the registration is skipped whenever the Host declares `plugins.row.config`, so 0.2 renders the component exactly once.

## 0.5.0+4

### Changed
- **The four `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges now admit DeepSeek Harness 0.2.0-rc.2.** They were `^0.1.0`, which does not admit `0.2.0-rc.2` (semver evaluates the range as false with or without `includePrerelease`, so the compatibility preflight in the kernel denied the plugin before it loaded). Each range is now `^0.1.0 || 0.2.0-rc.2`: every 0.1.x resolution is unchanged, the new harness satisfies the second alternative, and no code changes were needed — the manifest is the only thing the preflight reads.
- The entry affects `dsh-tools`, `dsh-credentials`, `dsh-commands` and `dsh-system-prompt`; `@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `schemastery` and `ws` are untouched because the preflight only evaluates `@deepseek-ai/dsh` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peers.

## 0.5.0+3

### Changed
- **Port assignments are no longer a plugin config key.** `forwardPorts` (added in 0.4.3) was removed from the schema: a fixed local port is a fact about *this machine* at *this moment* — it depends on what is free locally — so a declarative profile entry was the wrong home for it, and having two writable sources meant a deletion needed a tombstone to beat the config layer. Assignments now live only in `~/.dsh/bas-remote/state.json`, set from Settings → BAS → Port settings or `/bas ports set <devSpace> <dropbear> <bridge>`.
  - If a profile still sets `forwardPorts`, `apply()` now fails with an explicit error instead of silently letting the pinned ports fall back to random. Remove the key to continue.
  - The `removedForwardPorts` tombstone list is gone with it; a state file written by 0.5.0+2 still loads, and the obsolete field is dropped on the next write.
  - `forwardPortsStrict` stays a config key — it is a global policy default, not per-machine data, and it still supplies strict mode until the settings page toggle overrides it in state.

### Added
- The port route validates what it is given (an object per dev space, each port an integer `0`–`65535`, where `0` means "random"). It previously accepted anything: nothing checked writes, because the schema only ever validated the config layer. The whole payload is validated before any of it is applied, so a bad entry cannot leave half a batch in memory but unwritten on disk.

### Fixed
- `0` is still a storable value meaning "let the kernel choose", so pinning one endpoint while leaving the other random keeps working.

## 0.5.0+2

### Fixed
- **Port settings: a row can actually be deleted now.** The UI posted the assignment map with the key removed, but `/bas-remote/ports` merges, so an absent key could never beat the stored value and the row returned on the next poll. A deletion now travels as an explicit `null`, and it is remembered (`removedForwardPorts`) — otherwise an assignment that comes from the `forwardPorts` config layer could not be deleted at all. `/bas ports clear` records the same tombstone.
- **Port settings: the fields match the rest of the page.** The dev-space id and port inputs were raw `<input>` elements with browser-default chrome sitting next to the Landscapes field. Every field now uses the shared `Input` component, so border, background, radius and font size cannot drift again.
- **The starting/connecting spinner turns again.** The `@keyframes dsh-bas-spin` stylesheet was removed the instant it was installed: `ctx.effect` runs its callback immediately and treats the *return value* as the disposer, and the teardown was passed in as the setup. The install now happens inside the effect and follows the first-party idiom (`typeof document` guard, `data-plugin-css` dedupe, removal only on unload).
- **A configured fixed port is honored for the dropbear endpoint.** `Number.isFinite(localPort)` accepted the caller's default `0` as a real request, so `bas_connect` always took a random port and `forwardPorts[<id>].dropbear` was silently ignored — only the bridge port was applied. An explicit `localPort` still wins.
- `bas_status`, `/bas ports` and the settings page now report one effective view (`effectiveForwardPorts` / `effectiveStrict`) instead of deriving config-plus-state separately, so the listing and the strict toggle cannot disagree with what is bound.

### Added
- `test/ports.test.mjs` drives the real route handlers (add, delete, re-add, the config layer, the strict toggle, legacy state files).
- The client test stub is now a minimal but real DOM and models cordis's `ctx.effect` faithfully — the mismatch between the old no-op stub and the real effect semantics is exactly what hid the spinner bug.

### Changed
- `npm test` was red since 0.4.5 (the client test crashed on `document.createElement`); it is green again and now covers the three reported UI defects.
- `test/live-devspace.mjs` resolves its config from `Config` instead of copying defaults by hand; the hand-kept list had already lost `forwardPorts` and `forwardPortsStrict`, so it never exercised strict mode.

## 0.4.6

### Fixed
- Port configurations now auto-save on every change, so unsaved configs no longer disappear when poll() refreshes state.

### Added
- Strict mode toggle: always visible in port settings, click to switch between strict (error on occupied port) and lenient (fallback to random).
- Dev space ID is now displayed alongside the label in dev space list.

## 0.4.5

### Fixed
- Settings page crashed with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'forwardPorts')` when `state` was still `null` before the first poll completed. Added null guards.
- Spinner icon in "starting" and "connecting" states was not animating. The `@keyframes dsh-bas-spin` CSS rule was referenced but never defined.

## 0.4.4

### Fixed
- Plugin failed to import with `z.record is not a function` error. Changed `z.record` to `z.dict` which is the correct schemastery method.

## 0.4.3

### Added
- **Per-dev-space fixed port assignments**: Configure fixed local ports for dropbear and bridge endpoints per dev space. Example in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  dsh-bas-remote:
    forwardPorts:
      ws-4gdt1: { dropbear: 44000, bridge: 44001 }
    forwardPortsStrict: true
  ```
- **Port checking**: Before connecting, the plugin checks if the configured port is available. In strict mode (default), an occupied port causes an error. In lenient mode, it falls back to a random port.
- **Web UI port settings**: Edit port assignments in Settings → BAS Remote Dev Spaces → Port Settings. Supports adding, editing, and removing entries.
- **TUI `/bas ports` command**: View and manage port assignments:
  - `/bas ports` — show all assignments
  - `/bas ports set <wsId> <dropbear> <bridge>` — set fixed ports
  - `/bas ports clear <wsId>` — remove assignment

### Fixed
- Settings page crashed with `state is not defined` when rendering the sftp rw_connect hint.

## 0.4.2

### Fixed
- Settings page crashed with  when rendering the sftp rw_connect hint.

## 0.4.1

### Fixed
- Settings page now shows both the ssh and sftp endpoints (`ssh 127.0.0.1:PORT · sftp 127.0.0.1:PORT`) and the `rw_connect` command for the sftp port, so users know which port to use for remote workspace tools. Previously only the dropbear endpoint was shown.

## 0.4.0

### Added
- **SFTP in BAS dev spaces.** A dev space's sshd is dropbear and the image ships no `sftp-server` (`/usr/lib/sftp-server` is missing; no root, `/usr/lib` is read-only), so SFTP failed with exit code 127 and `rw_stat`, `rw_read_file`, `rw_write_file`, `rw_sync`, `rw_push` and dsh-remote's mirror/pick reported `not a directory (or unreachable)`. The plugin now installs its own SSH server **inside** the dev space (`lib/bridge-server.cjs`, exec **and** SFTP), listening on `127.0.0.1:2223` only, authorised with exactly the dev-space key the landscape handed out, and forwarded over the same dev channel. `bas_connect` reports that endpoint for `rw_connect`, so one port serves everything; the dropbear endpoint stays for plain `ssh`/`scp -O`/`tar`.
  - Setup is idempotent and cached in the dev space (`~/.dsh-bas-remote/sftp-bridge/`): the server is re-uploaded only when its hash changes and `ssh2` is installed once with the dev space's own npm (a few seconds, ~1 MB).
  - The forward is verified end to end (handshake + `stat("/")`) before it is advertised; if the bridge cannot start, the connect still succeeds and the result says `SFTP bridge … unavailable: <reason>`, leaving the endpoint exec-only.
  - New config: `sftpBridge` (default `true`), `sftpBridgePort` (2223), `sftpBridgeDir`, `sftpBridgeInstall`, `sftpBridgeTimeoutMs`.
  - New tool `bas_bridge` (`status` | `stop`) reporting installed/running/pid/listening and the daemon log tail. `bas_disconnect` stops the daemon before closing the tunnel; a daemon left behind by a dropped tunnel is replaced on the next connect.
- `test/bridge-server.test.mjs` (`npm test`): starts the real bridge server and asserts, with a real ssh2 client, that it refuses any other key and serves the full exec + SFTP surface (stat/readdir/read/write/fastPut/fastGet/mkdir/rename/unlink/rmdir/symlink/realpath, seconds-based timestamps, `NO_SUCH_FILE` for missing paths).

### Fixed
- **`bas_disconnect`/`bas_start` could not find a connected dev space by its id.** Tunnel keys are `<landscape>/<dev space id>` and the lookup sliced the key at the first `/`, which lands inside `https://`, so matching by id (or id prefix) never worked for a URL landscape; only the label or the full key did. Matching now uses the stored id/label.
- **The dev channel was given up on after one failed handshake.** `Failed to read the protocol version` (and similar) happens intermittently; `bas_connect` now retries the handshake up to `connectAttempts` times (default 3, 1.5 s/3 s backoff) before reporting the failure.
- The bridge daemon died on an unhandled ssh2 `client-timeout` (a client that vanishes — a killed harness, a dropped tunnel — makes the server's keepalive fail and emit `error`); those errors are now logged, and the daemon also survives an uncaught exception instead of disappearing mid-session.
- Replacing a stale bridge daemon now also kills the process owning the bridge port, so an older daemon that does not match the command-line pattern cannot keep the port occupied. The server writes its own pid file (`setsid` makes `$!` the wrapper, not node).

### Changed
- The shell chip (`BAS · N`) no longer dispatches a `dsh-navigate` event that nothing listens to: it opens its own panel listing the connected dev spaces with their `ssh` and `sftp` endpoints. The settings page lists both endpoints per tunnel as well.

## 0.3.2

### Fixes
- Web UI: the tunnel indicator rendered as a full-width translucent band across the top instead of a chip. `shell.overlay` renders each seat as a plain child of `.overlayLayer`, which spans the whole frame, so a block-level pill stretched to that width. It is now anchored as a compact chip (`position: absolute`, bottom-right, `width: max-content`) with a shadow and backdrop blur, and reads `BAS · N`.

### Changed
- `bas_connect` no longer tells you to `rw_pick_workspace` as if every remote tool worked. BAS dev spaces run dropbear without an `sftp-server` (`/usr/lib/sftp-server` is missing from the image), so the SFTP-based tools — `rw_stat`, `rw_read_file`, `rw_write_file`, `rw_sync`, `rw_push` and dsh-remote's mirror/pick (`not a directory (or unreachable)`) — cannot work there. The result now says so and prints the working alternatives (`scp -O`, `tar | ssh`) with the current port and key. Exec channels (`rw_exec`, `ssh <cmd>`) are unaffected.
- Tool descriptions for `bas_status`, `bas_connect` and `bas_disconnect` no longer claim a `~/.ssh/config` entry is always written.

### Documentation
- README: what a BAS dev space can and cannot serve, with the live evidence per capability (exec yes, SFTP no, legacy `scp -O` yes, `tar` yes, no `rsync`).

## 0.3.1

### Fixes
- **SSH was reported as unavailable on dev spaces that do serve SSH.** Availability was inferred from a `vscode…ssh` entry in the `optionalExtensions` annotation, which a BAS dev space does not need to expose its key: the plugin showed "SSH not enabled" and refused to connect on a dev space whose `GET <runtime startup url>/key` answered 200 with an OpenSSH key. Availability is now *probed* against that endpoint (60 s cache) and `sshEnabled` is tri-state — `true`, `false`, or `null` while the space is not running and nothing can be probed. `bas_connect` no longer refuses on the annotation and only reports the runtime when the key request itself fails.
- `bas_connect` in `fragment` mode wrote the fragment to `~/.ssh/dsh-bas-remote.conf` even when `sshDir`/`sshConfigPath` pointed elsewhere; it now resolves next to the key directory.

### Changed
- **Nothing is written to `~/.ssh/config` unless explicitly configured.** A nix/home-manager managed SSH config is normally immutable (this plugin's own environment showed the file as read-only) and any write would be reverted on the next switch. The new `sshConfigMode` is `off` by default: `bas_connect` then reports the key path, the loopback endpoint and the exact `Host` block to paste. `fragment` maintains `<sshDir>/dsh-bas-remote.conf` (marked blocks, removed on disconnect) for an `Include`; `config` keeps the previous behaviour and stays reachable through `sshConfigMode: 'config'` or the legacy `manageSshConfig: true`. Every mode refuses to write a target that is a symlink, not a regular file, or not writable, and reports why instead of failing.

### Features
- Web UI: every dev space in the list is now a card (status dot, name, state and SSH badge on one row; controls on the next; hints on their own line) so the "add the Remote Access extension" hint no longer pushes the Stop and Refresh buttons apart.
- Web UI: the SSH badge reflects the probed state, Connect appears for a running space whose key is available, and a connected space names its SSH alias, including when the entry was not published to any config.

## 0.3.0

### Features
- Dev-space lifecycle control, mirroring the SAP VS Code extension's Dev Space Manager: `PUT <landscape>/ws-manager/api/v1/workspace/<id>` with `{"Suspended": false|true, "WorkspaceDisplayName": "<name>"}` starts (resumes) and stops (suspends) a dev space. New model tools `bas_start` and `bas_stop`, new `/bas start|stop` subcommands, and a non-blocking `/bas-remote/devspace` route.
- `bas_connect` starts a `STOPPED` dev space first and waits for `RUNNING` before fetching the key and opening the tunnel, instead of failing on an empty startup URL. Start/stop waits poll the runtime status (ceiling: `devSpaceTimeoutMs`, default 240 s).
- The BAS limit of two running or starting dev spaces per landscape is enforced with the names of the spaces holding the slots, as `isItPossibleToStart` does upstream.
- Web UI: per-dev-space **Start** / **Stop** buttons, neutral grey for `STOPPED`, amber for `STARTING`/`STOPPING`, red for `ERROR`/`SAFE_MODE`, a live "Starting…"/"Stopping…" state that follows the status until it settles, and a "Connecting…" state for the connect action.

### Fixes
- `getDevSpaceKey` no longer reports a missing startup URL as "enable the Remote Access extension" when the real cause is a dev space that is not running; the error now names the runtime status.

## 0.2.2

### Fixes
- Web UI: the settings page showed a red status dot and a "Sign in" button even while signed in. `/bas-remote/state` answers `{ ok, state, auth }` — `auth` is a sibling of `state` — but the page stored only `state` and every consumer reads `state.auth`, so `signedIn` was always false. The auth states are now merged into the stored snapshot, which also unblocks the automatic dev-space fetch.

### Documentation
- Explain that a connection ends in a standard SSH transport over the dev-channel WebSocket (remote development, editors, `rw_connect`), and link the upstream [SAP/app-studio-toolkit](https://github.com/SAP/app-studio-toolkit) reference.

## 0.2.1

### Fixes
- Sign-in no longer fails with `credential key segment "…" must match /^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`: the credential store only admits lowercase hyphenated key segments, which a BAS landscape host never is (dotted, often digit-leading), so every browser hand-off failed at the store step. The record id is now a slug of the landscape host plus a short digest of the exact host.

## 0.2.0
